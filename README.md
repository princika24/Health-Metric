This project involves the analysis of health metrics using Support Vector Machines (SVM). 
The primary goal is to predict health outcomes based on various health-related metrics. 
SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression tasks.
The final outcome of the model is one of the three classes which are poor, fair and good. These classes are label encoded and identified using the SVM algorithm.
This methodology facilitates the determination of an individual's health status.
